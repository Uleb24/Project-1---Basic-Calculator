# Project-1---Basic-Calculator
It has basic functionalities like additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions and even putting to the power ! 

Very simple and basic Python code, with lots of potential for further improvement of course.

This is my first ever project and my goal is to create as many of them as possible, each new one being more cool and more complex than the previous :)

Hopefully this is the start of a new and successful journey !
